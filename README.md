# video-graphics-generators

A website that contains code used to record graphics used in LM videos.
Videos can be generated at: https://launchmenu.github.io/video-graphics-generators/build

Everything is created a bit hastily, with the first animation being created in 2 days from the ground up, so code quality isn't amazing. I however think the `ISequencable` idea is quite nice, and will explorer this idea further at a later date.
